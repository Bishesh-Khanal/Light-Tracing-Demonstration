# Light-Tracing-Demonstration

Experience realistic light behavior in a 2D environment where a point source of light—controlled by the mouse cursor—illuminates the surroundings. Obstacles in the environment cast shadows, blocking light from reaching certain areas, creating a dynamic interplay of light and dark. Using C++ and SFML, this program simulates how light interacts with opaque objects, offering a visually immersive demonstration of realistic light behavior in a 2D world.
